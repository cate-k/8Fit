# 8Fit
### What is 8Fit?
8Fit is a DApp that combines the features of a habit management application with a fitness and wellness tracker. Users can track their health, fitness, and wellness progress using 8Fit. For example, some features include keeping track of the user's daily steps taken, hours slept, and how long they did a cardio activity for.

### Technology
8Fit is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses ReactJS, Moralis, Truffle, and Ganache. It has two smart contracts deployed on the Goerli testnet, which can be found [here](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x83a052C2723287CC26F8Cc5d6E5CbC8E9B90A3d9) and [here](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x560d225B132A5fBe5cfdC15C93A82b2D7E46d344).

### Note
This project was created for the unit Building IT Systems in October 2022 and was finished in November 2022.

### How It Works
**1.** The user can connect their MetaMask wallet to 8Fit on the home page to sign in.

**2.** Upon connecting their MetaMask wallet, the user will be redirected to their profile, where they can view and edit details such as their display name, age, height, and weight.

**3.** On the dashboard, the user can view a progress bar showing how many points they have earned in total and their current level, how much progress they've completed out of their daily goals (e.g. 7000 out of 10000 steps taken today), and their achievements.

Each badge under the achievements section will be greyed out initially, and it will be fully coloured in when the user has accomplished the criteria for the badge.

**4.** The user can select which sub-category in the fitness section they would like to navigate to.

**5.** On the "Steps" page, the user can view and edit their daily and weekly goals of how many steps they aim to take. Below the goals is an input for the user to log how many steps they took today, and previous logs are also displayed underneath.

**6.** The user can view and edit their daily and weekly goals of how many minutes of cardio activities they would like to accomplish. They can also enter the activity completed, duration, and intensity, and view previous logs below.

The "Strength Training" page works similarly to the "Cardio" page, so for brevity it is not displayed here.

**7.** On the "Nutrition" page, the user can view and edit their weight goal and log how many calories they have eaten and burned.

**8.** The user can enter their daily and weekly sleep goals and wellbeing goals on the "Wellbeing" page. They may also log how many hours they slept each night and any wellbeing activities they have done.
